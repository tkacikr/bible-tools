			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>Blessed <i>be</i> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds through Christ. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>Now if we are afflicted, <i>it is</i> for your consolation and salvation, which is effective for enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer. Or if we are comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>And our hope for you <i>is</i> steadfast, because we know that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also <i>you will partake</i> of the consolation.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>For we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, of our trouble which came to us in Asia: that we were burdened beyond measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>Yes, we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves but in God who raises the dead, ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver us; in whom we trust that He will still deliver <i>us,</i> ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>you also helping together in prayer for us, that thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf for the gift <i>granted</i> to us through many.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>For our boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience that we conducted ourselves in the world in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God, and more abundantly toward you. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>For we are not writing any other things to you than what you read or understand. Now I trust you will understand, even to the end ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>(as also you have understood us in part), that we are your boast as you also <i>are</i> ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>And in this confidence I intended to come to you before, that you might have a second benefit&#x2014; ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>to pass by way of you to Macedonia, to come again from Macedonia to you, and be helped by you on my way to Judea. ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, when I was planning this, did I do it lightly? Or the things I plan, do I plan according to the flesh, that with me there should be Yes, Yes, and No, No? ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>But <i>as</i> God <i>is</i> faithful, our word to you was not Yes and No. ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us&#x2014;by me, Silvanus, and Timothy&#x2014;was not Yes and No, but in Him was Yes. ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>For all the promises of God in Him <i>are</i> Yes, and in Him Amen, to the glory of God through us. ",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and has anointed us <i>is</i> God, ",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>who also has sealed us and given us the Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>Moreover I call God as witness against my soul, that to spare you I came no more to Corinth. ",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>Not that we have dominion over your faith, but are fellow workers for your joy; for by faith you stand."
		},
		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2&#xA0;</span>But I determined this within myself, that I would not come again to you in sorrow. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>For if I make you sorrowful, then who is he who makes me glad but the one who is made sorrowful by me?",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>And I wrote this very thing to you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow over those from whom I ought to have joy, having confidence in you all that my joy is <i>the joy</i> of you all. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you, with many tears, not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have so abundantly for you.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>But if anyone has caused grief, he has not grieved me, but all of you to some extent&#x2014;not to be too severe. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>This punishment which <i>was inflicted</i> by the majority <i>is</i> sufficient for such a man, ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>so that, on the contrary, you <i>ought</i> rather to forgive and comfort <i>him</i>, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with too much sorrow. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>Therefore I urge you to reaffirm <i>your</i> love to him. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>For to this end I also wrote, that I might put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all things. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>Now whom you forgive anything, I also <i>forgive</i>. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ, ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>lest Satan should take advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Furthermore, when I came to Troas to <i>preach</i> Christ&#x2019;s gospel, and a door was opened to me by the Lord, ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I departed for Macedonia.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>Now thanks <i>be</i> to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us diffuses the fragrance of His knowledge in every place. ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>For we are to God the fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>To the one <i>we are</i> the aroma of death <i>leading</i> to death, and to the other the aroma of life <i>leading</i> to life. And who <i>is</i> sufficient for these things? ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>For we are not, as so many, peddling the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as from God, we speak in the sight of God in Christ."
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3&#xA0;</span>Do we begin again to commend ourselves? Or do we need, as some <i>others</i>, epistles of commendation to you or <i>letters</i> of commendation from you? ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>You are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read by all men; ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>clearly you are an epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of flesh, <i>that is,</i> of the heart.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>And we have such trust through Christ toward God. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think of anything as <i>being</i> from ourselves, but our sufficiency <i>is</i> from God, ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>who also made us sufficient as ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>But if the ministry of death, written <i>and</i> engraved on stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of the glory of his countenance, which <i>glory</i> was passing away, ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>how will the ministry of the Spirit not be more glorious? ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>For if the ministry of condemnation <i>had</i> glory, the ministry of righteousness exceeds much more in glory. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>For even what was made glorious had no glory in this respect, because of the glory that excels. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>For if what is passing away <i>was</i> glorious, what remains <i>is</i> much more glorious.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, since we have such hope, we use great boldness of speech&#x2014; ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>unlike Moses, <i>who</i> put a veil over his face so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the end of what was passing away. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>But their minds were blinded. For until this day the same veil remains unlifted in the reading of the Old Testament, because the <i>veil</i> is taken away in Christ. ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>But even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>Nevertheless when one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord <i>is</i>, there <i>is</i> liberty. ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord."
		},
		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4&#xA0;</span>Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we do not lose heart. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man&#x2019;s conscience in the sight of God. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your bondservants for Jesus&#x2019; sake. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>For it is the God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts to <i>give</i> the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup><i>We are</i> hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; <i>we are</i> perplexed, but not in despair; ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed&#x2014; ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus&#x2019; sake, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>So then death is working in us, but life in you.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>And since we have the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, <span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;I believed and therefore I spoke,&#x201D;</span> we also believe and therefore speak, ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>knowing that He who raised up the Lord Jesus will also raise us up with Jesus, and will present <i>us</i> with you. ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>For all things <i>are</i> for your sakes, that grace, having spread through the many, may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>Therefore we do not lose heart. Even though our outward <i>man</i> is perishing, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day. ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding <i>and</i> eternal weight of glory, ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen <i>are</i> temporary, but the things which <i>are</i> not seen are eternal."
		},
		"5": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">5&#xA0;</span>For we know that if our earthly house, <i>this</i> tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven, ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>if indeed, having been clothed, we shall not be found naked. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>For we who are in <i>this</i> tent groan, being burdened, not because we want to be unclothed, but further clothed, that mortality may be swallowed up by life. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>Now He who has prepared us for this very thing <i>is</i> God, who also has given us the Spirit as a guarantee.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>So <i>we are</i> always confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>For we walk by faith, not by sight. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>We are confident, yes, well pleased rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>Therefore we make it our aim, whether present or absent, to be well pleasing to Him. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things <i>done</i> in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>Knowing, therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are well known to God, and I also trust are well known in your consciences.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>For we do not commend ourselves again to you, but give you opportunity to boast on our behalf, that you may have <i>an answer</i> for those who boast in appearance and not in heart. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>For if we are beside ourselves, <i>it is</i> for God; or if we are of sound mind, <i>it is</i> for you. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if One died for all, then all died; ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, from now on, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know <i>Him thus</i> no longer. ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, if anyone <i>is</i> in Christ, <i>he is</i> a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new. ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>Now all things <i>are</i> of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation, ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore <i>you</i> on Christ&#x2019;s behalf, be reconciled to God. ",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>For He made Him who knew no sin <i>to be</i> sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him."
		},
		"6": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">6&#xA0;</span>We then, <i>as</i> workers together <i>with Him</i> also plead with <i>you</i> not to receive the grace of God in vain. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>For He says:<span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;In an acceptable time I have heard you,</span><span class=\"oblique\">And in the day of salvation I have helped you.&#x201D;</span>Behold, now <i>is</i> the accepted time; behold, now <i>is</i> the day of salvation.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>We give no offense in anything, that our ministry may not be blamed. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>But in all <i>things</i> we commend ourselves as ministers of God: in much patience, in tribulations, in needs, in distresses, ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in fastings; ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>by purity, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by sincere love, ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and <i>yet</i> true; ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>as unknown, and <i>yet</i> well known; as dying, and behold we live; as chastened, and <i>yet</i> not killed; ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and <i>yet</i> possessing all things.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>O Corinthians! We have spoken openly to you, our heart is wide open. ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your <i>own</i> affections. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>Now in return for the same (I speak as to children), you also be open.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has light with darkness? ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>And what accord has Christ with Belial? Or what part has a believer with an unbeliever? ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God.

		},
		"7": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">7&#xA0;</span>Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>Open <i>your hearts</i> to us. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have cheated no one. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>I do not say <i>this</i> to condemn; for I have said before that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live together. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>Great <i>is</i> my boldness of speech toward you, great <i>is</i> my boasting on your behalf. I am filled with comfort. I am exceedingly joyful in all our tribulation.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>For indeed, when we came to Macedonia, our bodies had no rest, but we were troubled on every side. Outside <i>were</i> conflicts, inside <i>were</i> fears. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>Nevertheless God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus, ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>and not only by his coming, but also by the consolation with which he was comforted in you, when he told us of your earnest desire, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even more.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>For even if I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it; though I did regret it. For I perceive that the same epistle made you sorry, though only for a while. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that your sorrow led to repentance. For you were made sorry in a godly manner, that you might suffer loss from us in nothing. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>For godly sorrow produces repentance <i>leading</i> to salvation, not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world produces death. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>For observe this very thing, that you sorrowed in a godly manner: What diligence it produced in you, <i>what clearing of yourselves, what</i> indignation, <i>what</i> fear, <i>what</i> vehement desire, <i>what</i> zeal, <i>what</i> vindication! In all <i>things</i> you proved yourselves to be clear in this matter. ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, although I wrote to you, <i>I did</i> not <i>do it</i> for the sake of him who had done the wrong, nor for the sake of him who suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>Therefore we have been comforted in your comfort. And we rejoiced exceedingly more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>For if in anything I have boasted to him about you, I am not ashamed. But as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting to Titus was found true. ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>And his affections are greater for you as he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>Therefore I rejoice that I have confidence in you in everything."
		},
		"8": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">8&#xA0;</span>Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia: ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded in the riches of their liberality. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>For I bear witness that according to <i>their</i> ability, yes, and beyond <i>their</i> ability, <i>they were</i> freely willing, ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>imploring us with much urgency that we would receive the gift and the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>And not <i>only</i> as we had hoped, but they first gave themselves to the Lord, and <i>then</i> to us by the will of God. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>So we urged Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also complete this grace in you as well. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>But as you abound in everything&#x2014;in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love for us&#x2014;<i>see</i> that you abound in this grace also.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>I speak not by commandment, but I am testing the sincerity of your love by the diligence of others. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>And in this I give advice: It is to your advantage not only to be doing what you began and were desiring to do a year ago; ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>but now you also must complete the doing <i>of it;</i> that as <i>there was</i> a readiness to desire <i>it,</i> so <i>there</i> also <i>may be</i> a completion out of what <i>you</i> have. ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>For if there is first a willing mind, <i>it is</i> accepted according to what one has, <i>and</i> not according to what he does not have.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>For <i>I do</i> not mean that others should be eased and you burdened; ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>but by an equality, <i>that</i> now at this time your abundance <i>may supply</i> their lack, that their abundance also may <i>supply</i> your lack&#x2014;that there may be equality. ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>As it is written, <span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;He who</span> <i>gathered</i> <span class=\"oblique\">much had nothing left over, and he who</span> <i>gathered</i> <span class=\"oblique\">little had no lack.&#x201D;</span>",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>But thanks <i>be</i> to God who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus. ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>For he not only accepted the exhortation, but being more diligent, he went to you of his own accord. ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>And we have sent with him the brother whose praise <i>is</i> in the gospel throughout all the churches, ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>and not only <i>that,</i> but who was also chosen by the churches to travel with us with this gift, which is administered by us to the glory of the Lord Himself and <i>to show</i> your ready mind, ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>avoiding this: that anyone should blame us in this lavish gift which is administered by us&#x2014; ",
